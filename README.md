# Deploy-time Network Optimization Tool Box

In this repository, we released code for the combination of different deploy time network optimization algorithm.
- spatial decomposition (SD)
- network decoupling (ND)
- channel decomposition (CD)

The current network supported: VGG-16, ResNet series, DenseNet series and AlexNet-bn.

2. [Installation](#installation-sufficient-for-the-demo)
3. [Usage](#channel-pruning)  
4. [Reference](#reference)

### Requirements
1. Python3 packages you might not have: `scipy`, `sklearn`, `easydict`, use `sudo pip3 install` to install.
2. An NVIDIA GPU is recommanded.

### Installation (sufficient for the demo)
1. Clone the repository of Caffe and compile it
    ```Shell
    git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git
    cd caffe
    # modify Makefile.config to the path of the library on your machine, please make sure the python3 interface is supported
    make -j8
    make pycaffe
    ```
2. Clone this repository 
    ```Shell
    git clone https://github.com/Betterthinking/network-decoupling.git
    ```
    
### Usage  
1. Download the original model files (.prototxt and .caffemodel) and move them to the directory of `models`

2. Make proper configurations in `config.py`
   To make sure the network optimization works well, please enter the file `config.py` and change the configuration of the parameters according to the comment above them. Here is an example of `config.py`
   ```Python
   from easydict import EasyDict as edict
    # construct parameters for different method
    SD_param = edict()
    ND_param = edict()
    CD_param = edict()
    # decide if SD is driven by data
    SD_param['data_driven'] = False
    # FLOPs compression ratio (per layer) for each layer in SD
    SD_param['c_ratio'] = 3
    # enable trigger for SD
    SD_param['enable'] = False
    # threshold of energy ratio for network decoupling
    ND_param['energy_threshold'] = 0.9
    # enable trigger for ND
    ND_param['enable'] = True
    # FLOPs compression ratio (per layer) for each layer in CD
    CD_param['c_ratio'] = 2
    # enable trigger for CD
    CD_param['enable'] = False 
    # dict containg layers not requiring spatial decomposition
    mask_layers = ['conv1','fc6']
    # gpu device (-1 for CPU)
    device_id = 0
    # parameters for data driven decoupling
    # the input layer name of network
    data_layer = 'data'
    # the dataset used for data reconstruction
    dataset = 'imagenet'
    # samples of batches for data reconstruction
    nSamples = 600
    # extract how many points per sample
    nPointsPerSample = 10
    # accurate or mAP layer names for data driven method (default value is accuracy@5 in vgg-16)
    accname = 'acc/top-5'
    # the name of frozen pickle to store sample points
    frozen_name = 'frozen'
    # test param
    caffe_path = '/home/jli59/yuxili/ker2col-caffe/build/tools/caffe'
    # imagenet val source
    imagenet_val = '/data/sde/jli59/jianbo/lmdb/ilsvrc12_val_lmdb'
    # cifar10 val source
    cifar10_val = '/path/to/cifar10_val'
   ```

3. Command Line Usage
To decouple a network, use the following command
    ```Shell
    python3.5 main.py <optional arguments>
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -sd                   enable spatial decomposition
      -nd                   enable network decoupling
      -cd                   enable channel decompostion
      -data                 enable data driven for spatial decomposition
      -speed SPEED          sd speed up ratio of spatial decomposition
      -threshold THRESHOLD  energy threshold for network decouple
      -gpu GPU              caffe devices
      -model MODEL          caffe prototxt file path
      -weight WEIGHT        caffemodel file path
      -action {decomp,compute,test}
                            compute, test or decompose the model
      -iterations ITER      test iterations
    ```

Note: the decomposition results is saved under the directory of `models`. When the `action` FLAG is `compute`, the program will compute the FLOPs of specified model. When the `action` FLAG is `test`, the program will test the model accuracy on specified dataset.

Some of the parameters could be specified by a FLAG in command line (e.g. gpu, speed), if they are not specified, the system will use the default value in configuration file `config.py`.

The combinations of sd + cd and sd + nd + cd are not supported now.
